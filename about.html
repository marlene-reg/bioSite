			<p> Evonne is a young hard-working nurse in the medical field that strives 
			    her best to assist people with their health. She chooses her current profession
                            because she enjoys helping people and has great interest in the medical field 
			    with a great exception of not feeling grossed out amongst injury and any other 
			    illnesses. Patients and co-workers tend to compliment her work and personality
			    due to her consistency and patience in many situations. A few of Evonne’s strongest
			    traits are not panicking while under pressure, communicating very well with everyone, 
			    and are very clear about topics that others may not have initially understood. During 
			    her journey as a nurse Evonne had to face some big challenges but regardless, she remained
			    grateful because completing nursing school was a big accomplishment for her. Currently,
			    Evonne feels like she is where she wants to be and is not looking for further education. 
			    In 5 years, Evonne sees herself still working in the medical field and hopes to own her 
			    first home by then. She currently resides in Long Beach where she enjoys gardening, primarily
 			    growing fruits and vegetables, likes to read a lot, and loves to cruise around the city on her
			    motorcycle. Although Evonne is open to traveling for work, she is not currently actively seeking
			    it as she would rather spend some leisure time travelling and enjoy a slow-paced vacation after 
			    achieving her accomplishments. Her favorite season is fall because as she said it “fall must be
			    my favorite because everything feels so crisp.”
